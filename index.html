        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Mourtada Mbaye’s major is Mechanical Engineering, the most popular major in this school. He chose it because he liked the scope of the major which allows him to dip my toes into almost every industry there is. It’s highly unlikely to find a company without a few mechanical engineers. The addition of the field being an ‘evergreen field’, which means that like an evergreen tree, the field will not die, is also appealing, especially with events such as automation replacing vast amounts of jobs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Mourtada Mbaye is from Weehawken. The town is very small, being given the nickname ‘the square-mile city’. It is very close to New York. In fact, the city sits on the other side of the Hudson River, which allows for a very scenic view of the city. Personally, he usually has a good amount of ideas, but I have a hard time fully explaining my ideas. Usually if he was asked to, he could explain something in a few short and sweet sentences, but if I was asked to fully flesh it out, I would likely have trouble. When looking over information, an analytical mindset is utilized, combing over lines to see their double meaning, such as looking at lines that tell everything that is needed to be known about the subject.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>What Mourtada enjoys in his past time is learning how to better express his ideas, as it would be very useful to learn in the future. The challenges that he faced in his new college life was mainly getting used to the step-up in coursework, like most students. Classes in high school had students get used to writing essays that consisted of a few pages, and now can expect  being asked to write papers that spanned upwards of 10 pages.  His passions besides becoming a notable mechanical engineer is traveling the world and seeing places he has never dreamed of seeing, especially since he would be the first member of his family to do so.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In terms of getting things done, Mourtada sticks to the standard of professionalism. Professionalism has a multitude of meanings. Professionalism is an umbrella term for the qualities that show that you are a good professional and that you have competence and skill. One example is to accommodate your fellow college students and professors. Ways to go about this are arriving early to your classes and keep deadlines in mind. Another skill is being ready to be able to work with others and develop the flexibility to work in tandem with their varying needs and schedules. Overall, professionalism as a student means keeping up with your studies and being an affable individual who can work well in a group.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Characteristics that define the “professional Mourtada” are the valuable tools that he has learned. He has grown to view the studies that he learns as training for my future professional life, and not simple busy work. The material must be learned, and simply obtaining an A is not suitable enough. He has also learned to get used to solving problems in order to help facilitate this view in his later life.
